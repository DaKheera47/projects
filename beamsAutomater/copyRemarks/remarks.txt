SELF ASSESSMENT OF STUDENT
 	
I participated in the International Kangaroo Mathematics Competition (IKMC) and won a key of success. I got better grades than last year in Islamiat and Pak studies. My English composition has gotten better. I have a better understanding of computer science. There are many challenges that I faced during this term. Revising for exams and memorizing all of it was really difficult. Writing my Individual Report (IR) was really tough for me. Although my Team Project went really well. I had experienced many new things this term. I went on a trip to the Cinema and watched the movie “ Khel khel mein” . It was really fun and it also helped us academically as it was related to our history syllabus. I learnt a lot of new topics in different subjects. I also learnt counting in Urdu from One till Hundred. I learnt the history of the Pakistani government and how it had shaped our country to what it is now. I struggle a lot with my handwriting and work presentation. I would really like to find a solution to this problem. I want to get better grades in the next term and also improve my handwriting and work presentation. I want to do better at my studies and get A*s.

SELF ASSESSMENT OF STUDENT
 	
Im Maira Mustafa of grade 10-Silver. This has been an exciting yet challenging year for all the students, especially me.Being on campus after the pandemic was an euphoric feeling,seeing the school buzz with life and laughter once again.The year started off with my selection as the Vice President of Media Society.Then i availed the opportunity of sending my speech to be presented in a seminar on “Urdu Day” and traditionally like every year i took part in IKLC. Before the term ended us seniors arranged a welcome party for our juniors, and I played my part on behalf of the media society to ensure recordings and decorations of the brilliantly thought out event.  Time management and coping up with the big pile of syllabus was the biggest challenge so far. I had to cram large portions of work in a small quantity of time, and this was where I had my learning experience as well, how to manage things and not panic at the last minute.

My attendance was regular in all my classes and assignments were turned in on due date.

Next term I want to participate in MUN as I sadly had to miss the opportunity this year not to mention I want to devote more time towards Pak Studies and Islamiat as the CIEs are not far away.Lastly, I just want to enjoy my year as a senior!

SELF ASSESSMENT OF STUDENT
 	
I was elected as Member of Student Council (Secretary of Learner`s Support Society), and I participated in the Bake Sale, IKLC, and the Fundraising Event. Math was quite challenging thie term as I found it a bit difficult to grasp some important concepts. Economics proved to be hard too, particularly graphs. I also found difficulty in polishing my 8 mark question which I believe needs practice. In my opinion the Bake Sale Event was a really interesting event especially for us Humanities Students, as here we could actually apply most of the business concepts we had learnt in class to real life. Also, History lessons always excited me since the section we were studying this term was based upon Ministries from 1947-99, as by learning history we make sure that specific things should not be repeated. This year I learnt an extended version of the business side, and I had a lot of fun studying it because it was really interesting. I polished my English writing skills a bit and learnt how to not be over-excessive with my vocabulary while writing. We studied loads of new chapters in Islamiyat, specifically "First Islamic Community" was really interesting to read about.  Firstly, MCQ`s can be a challenge for me. Despite grasping the concepts, I tend to get utterly confused when it comes to MCQ`s, especially Accounting. I have been regular in attendance, as Alhamdulillah no such situation came forward which would have forced me to take days off from school etc. As for the submission of assignments, I do try my level best to make sure they are handed in on time but sometimes due to being over-burdened they were delayed a bit. Nonetheless, I`ll ensure that all assignments are submitted on time from 2nd term so that it doesn`t bother me on the very last day before the exam. Obviously I am planning to give majority of my attention and time to Pak Studies and Islamiyat as I shall be appearing for its CAIE`s this year InshaAllah. I want to improve in math so my plans include more practice in past papers for that too. Overall I want to perform better in studies and bring even better grades.

 My achievements are to become a good student in this term and to get an efficient way of learning. I faced the very bad challenge of one of the covid viruses as well as dengue fever which attacked most of the people all over the world. I can comfort myself by having good friends and attending some interesting lectures. For some days we attend the online classes as well as face to face classes. Now we are going regularly. In this time period we enjoy with my family a lot and having some interesting fact like how can we faced in a bad time and how can we maintain our position for the some struggles. Yes, during the online classes time circle we also faced the disease viruses named as covid and dengue. We are always trying to save ourselves from this disease and find out the solution of the disease to protect ourselves. This time period give us many other  targets. To observe the natural facts in life, how can we consider these natural disasters And how can we protect ourselves from these natural disasters.So this is my opinion that I would like to comment here that  I learnt anything in this session.

SELF ASSESSMENT OF STUDENT
 	
I was chosen as Deputy head girl of BPCG and I took part in organizing various events such as the welcoming party for sixth graders. I also took part in a group project for Global Perspectives where me and my team members gave a speech and spread awareness about autism. The challenges I faced were mainly directed towards Islamiat and Pakistan study CIES being very close hence there was pressure of covering syllabus as well as coping with other subjects as well which made it very burdensome to juggle loads of syllabus with 10 subjects in total. The most interesting experience this term was going to cinegold to watch the movie "khel khel main" which was a movie related to the partition of Bangladesh and Pakistan. This opened new doors of information to us and made us consider different perspectives to our country`s history which was a very interesting learning experience. The new things I have learnt this term include interacting with more people and persuading them and being more logical in all my working Which I learned through the help of my campaign in running for Deputy head girl. I feel I struggle with time management between the subjects I have to study and it would be really beneficial if someone were to guide me on that matter. I have had almost perfect attendance except for the time I had gotten my COVID vaccine and the time I had skipped two days of school right before the midterm exam of Islamiat So that I could prepare for it in the comfort of my home. As far as assignment submission is concerned I have submitted almost all my assignments on time but sometimes when there`s too much burden in the week I do it on the weekend and submit it to the teacher. In the next term I hope to have better time management and a better schedule so I won`t have to be so stressed out during exam season since I would have everything prepared beforehand for all the subjects.

SELF ASSESSMENT OF STUDENT
 	
One of my biggest achievements this term was that I participated in the breast cancer awareness bake sale event. Some of the business students set up stalls to raise money for breast cancer patients and it turned out to be quite successful. We successfully raised a lot of money.Later on we were even rewarded with certificates to remember that event. A big challenge this term was to adapt to daily face to face classes as most of the last school year was spent online. As I was new to these subjects (business, economics, accounting) it was interesting to learn about them and I found out these are something I`m actually interested in and might look into for a career. I`ve learnt alot about business/economics, how everything works and it makes more sense now. I feel like I struggle with math and I would like to get my grades higher. Next term I want to focus more in class, especially in math and I want to achieve higher grades as well as ask more questions.

I have participated in bake sale project, which was one of the best stalls [Food Hive] I have participated in Urdu debate this year as well, and was featured in school website. I am new to this school, and have adjusted with every class and all my teachers which is something I thought I would never be able to do :) I have already gave my cies of urdu/islamiyat and pak studies, thus i feel ahead of my class. I faced problems first off, I joined school 1-2 months late as I was giving cies early than my class, and i had stress to take school work with it too, but now ive settled. Ive had a lot of free lessons as ive given my cies early of urdu/islamiyat and pak stud, thus i am only allowed to sit in library all day and not allowed to play outside to play sports or go to cafe during my free time, which really annoys me. An interesting experience was being well known in school sooner than I expected. I have learned to be more responsible, and be more careful with whatever actions im doing, and to intake the stress/sadness of failing a particular thing and performing better next time. I am regular student, and assign everything on time. I want to achieve A* in all subjects, and make sure I respect everyone and everyone respects me.

I took part in a fundraiser for the pink ribbon event and we ended up raising alot of money for it by opening up our own stall. Due to this i even received a certificate. Some challenges i faced in this term include keeping up with pakstudies and Islamiat for my upcoming Cies. Writing an IR report for GP was also quite challenging but with hope and dedication i faced them. Going to watch a movie about Bangladesh with my friends on a school trip was quiet interesting. Setting up our own food stall was also a very eventful experience. Through setting up a stall and earning profits and learning how to handle them in the pink ribbon even taught me basic skills of a business for the future along with some aspects of team work and dedication. My main weakness is at urdu and sometimes i struggle with the vocabulary and spellings of it however I`m looking to improve that by practicing everyday. Along with Urdu struggle with Maths aswell. I want to improve the things i struggle at and along with that i want to make Pakstudies and Islamiat my main focus for the upcoming CIEs.

My achievements this year include being elected as the vice president of learners support society, Hosting the welcome party of grade 6, managing to get all straight A`s and A*`s, and maintaining very good attendence. I faced some challenges this term too math was pretty tough this year. Maintaining a balance between studies and co-circular activities was something that was a challenge but i managed to execute it very well! Going on a Movie Trip to experience Khel Khel Main in the Cinema was the most memorable experience this term. Learning about Pakistani Political history and the mistakes committed by our leaders alongside their outcomes was the most interesting and new thing i learnt this year. Bangladesh`s partition history was also something pretty new to me and i enjoyed every bit of learning about it! Id love to find a solution to the difficulty I find in difficult Math Topics. My attendance was upto the mark throughout the whole term . My assignments were always submitted well before time and I managed to stay on top of my work. I`d love to further enhance my knowledge about my country`s political and historical history. I also for sure want to secure all three A*`s in my CAIES alongside a distinction too InshaAllah!

SELF ASSESSMENT OF STUDENT
 	
This is my 4 year in this school and this year I participated in many activities which were really interesting and which made me really confident about doing better in other things as well. I participated in the team project in Global perspective which was about “poverty”. I really enjoyed this project but it`s not fully complete… well this will take quite some time but oh well so far i am enjoying this journey i also learnt how to interact with my classmates and whom i never knew about at all- i guess i was a loner heh… well this year the main challenge is the CIE papers which is quite a lot of stress for me but i hope i will ace these exams! This year I improved in a lot of things. I have improved my English skills but I need to work on it more. I also focused a lot on the following subjects: Pak Studies,islamiat and global perspective. As i will appear in these exams in 2021...and i improved in some of these subjects which were history and gp but i need to improve more so i can achieve higher marks in other subjects as well..i never take a leave if there is no emergency which is good..in the next year i will improve more in maths.
